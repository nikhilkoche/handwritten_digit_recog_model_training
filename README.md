# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning(only model training)
Jupyter Notebook for training Neural Network on MNIST data.
This repository contains the ipynb for that trains a Neural Network on the MNIST Handwritten digits dataset. 

# Requirements

* Python 3.5 +
* Keras (latest version)
* Numpy (+ mkl for Windows)
* Jupyter Notebook


# Installing Jupyter Notebook on Ubuntu

### VirtualEnvironment

```
$ virtualenv mnist
$ source mnist/bin/activate
```
**Environment name is mnist**
